# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      The design considerations include setting Vpeak to avoid overflow and calculating Vth based on the precision of the system. The signal flow graph for this circuit involves delay elements(Z), adders, and a multiplier.
      B is the input, which goes through delay elements(Z) and is fed into the adder.
      The right side of the adder is connected to the gain(A), and the result is further processed.
      The output of the adder is the voltage is V.
      A feedback path from V is connected to another  delay element (z) and an additional Z connected to the same adder.
      There is another feedback path from V to a multiplier, which calculates V^2.
      The output of the multiplier V^2 is sent to another delay element (Z), which is connected to the left side of the adder circuit
      This signal flow represents a closed loop system where the input B is integrated and checked against threshold values(Vpeak and Vth) to determine the circuits behavior.  If the conditions are met, a reset event can occur. The precise functionality and behavior of this circuit depend on the values of A, Vpeak, Vreset and Vth, as well as the specific implementation of the delay elements and adders.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, the counter should increase by one every second with a 10MHz input clock.
      Experiment by changing the inputs to change the counting speed.
